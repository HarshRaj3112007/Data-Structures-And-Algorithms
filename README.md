## ⚡ Why This Exists
This isn't just a collection of LeetCode solutions. This repository documents my mastery of memory management, time-complexity optimization, and the low-level logic required for high-performance computing in **AI model optimization** and **Blockchain protocol development.**

## 🧭 Roadmap & Implementation Status
| Status | Module | Key Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ✅ | Basics & Recursion | Functional purity and stack limits |
| ✅ | Trees & Graphs | Foundation for Neural Networks & P2P Networks |
| 🚧 | Dynamic Programming | Optimization problems in Resource Allocation |
| 📅 | Advanced Graphs | Shortest paths in decentralized nodes |

## 📂 Engineering Standards
Each solution follows a strict implementation pattern:
1. **Problem Analysis:** Identifying constraints (N < 10^5, etc.)
2. **Logic:** Transition from Brute Force ($O(N^2)$) to Optimized ($O(N \log N)$ or $O(N)$).
3. **Complexity:** Explicit Space/Time analysis in headers.
4. **Clean Code:** Adhering to C++ naming conventions and DRY principles.

## 🚀 Strategic Goal
As a General Engineering student at **IIT Mandi**, I leverage DSA to bridge the gap between abstract mathematical concepts (AI/ML) and scalable execution (Web3).
